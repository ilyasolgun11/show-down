# **Show Down**

## **Site Overview** <a name="site-overview"></a>

Show Down is a guessing game where the user has to choose either Higher or Lower to move onto the next level, in the context of the "Random Mode", the user has to decide if the given data on the right's search volume is higher or lower than the left sides search volume (this is true on desktop screen, however on mobile screen it will be top and bottom)

The game's addictive nature makes it a perfect break from the outside world. The reason why it is addictive is because the user is trying to get a higher score each time they play and they learn something new as well.
