## **During Development Testing:** <a name="during-development-testing"></a>

While i was building the game, i was manually testing the responsiveness and functionality in the following ways:

- Manually testing each section for appearance and responsiveness using a live server (extension on VSCode).
- After i published my project through github pages i asked fellow student's at slacks "peer-code-review" channel to see if they can find any bugs.
- I published a post on LinkedIn and asked my network of 400+ developers to review, no issues were stated in the comments.

### [**Manual Testing**](#manual-testing)

During testing I used 5 different browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. The browsers used were:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Firefox developer edition
- Opera GX
- Microsoft Edge

For all the browsers i used their own devtools to simulate a mobile screen and no issues were found.
